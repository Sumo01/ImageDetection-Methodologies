# ImageDetection-Methodologies

This repo has all the image detection methodologies that are commonly used when performing analysis on image datasets and while performing computer vision tasks. It mainly employs the open-cv library in python. Explanation for each file in this repo is given below:

## Methodologies:
These are implementations of common methodologies along with examples for simple understanding. 
1. CannyEdgeDetection.ipynb
2. DilationandErosion.ipynb
3. FourierTransform.ipynb
4. HistogramEqualization.ipynb
5. HoughTransform.ipynb

## Modules:
These files have all the codes for the different methodologies for easy importing

### ImageIO.py
This file has all the input output operations that can be performed on the images.

1. '''ChangeDirectory(curr,new)''' - Changes the directory that the os is in from curr to new
